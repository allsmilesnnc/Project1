How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    There was less code to read through to find the error. 

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    You could learn better from your mistakes and you have a restore point saved if you need it. 

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    One of the cons is that you might forget when the update is manual but the automatically 
save may save to often and not at a good time

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Ease of use. 

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log allows you to see the commit history and git diff will show you the changes made
that will include the adds and deletes 

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    you can find the error with better ease. 

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
